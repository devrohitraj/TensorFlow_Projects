Palo Alto enjoys a Mediterranean climate, with dry summers and wet winters. Check Palo Alto's 7 day forecast at NOAA
Palo Alto means tall tree in Spanish, and in this case refers to an aging redwood tree at the north end of the city.
The 1061-year-old Coast Redwood, which stands 110 feet (34 m) high and has a base diameter of 90 inches (229 cm), marks a campsite for the Portola Expedition Party of 1769.
Get in[edit]
Accessible by train, bus or automobile from nearby San Francisco (about 25 miles/40 km) and San Jose (about 20 miles/32 km) airports. US 101 is the primary highway access, although I-280 also passes through the western edge of Palo Alto. Palo Alto Municipal Airport, which is a few miles from the center of the city, serves private aircraft.
By air[edit]
The cheapest way to get to Palo Alto from the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) was to take SamTrans bus KX, but this line no longer travels to Palo Alto.
It appears a connection in Redwood City is required.
An alternative is to take BART from SFO to Millbrae (via San Bruno on weekdays), and then take Caltrain from Millbrae to Palo Alto, which will cost $9.50.
Or take the KX (or another bus) to a CalTrain station.
From the San Jose International Airport (SJC), you first take the free shuttle bus #10 to get to the Santa Clara Caltrain station. From there you either take Caltrain, for $4.50, or take VTA bus 522 or 22 to get to Palo Alto for $2.
Get around[edit]
By bus[edit]
Bus service runs through most of the major areas within the city. Routes are concentrated around El Camino Real and University Avenue.
The Palo Alto Shuttle is free, and serves the otherwise unserved Embarcadero Road corridor, as well as the VA Hospital.
By bike[edit]
Bike lanes are nearly everywhere and make riding convenient and safe. One of the most prominent lanes runs down Bryant Street and takes you from South Palo Alto to the downtown district located in North Palo Alto.
By car[edit]
Automobiles are definitely the most convenient way to get around, and parking is plentiful everywhere except the downtown area. Municipal parking is complimentary and fairly well dispersed, but usually limited to 2 hours during the business day.
By train[edit]
Palo Alto and California Avenue are stops along the Bay Area train route known as Caltrain [12]. Both stations also have free shuttles (The Marguerite), which go to the Stanford University campus.
See[edit][add listing]
Stanford University— Located just outside Palo Alto. Offers cultural, athletic, natural and educational resources to Palo Alto visitors. For example, Outdoor Sculpture at Stanford University includes a very large collection of large scale works by Rodin in a garden immediately adjoining the museum of art. Look for Andy Goldsworthy's River of Stone a few steps from the museum's front entry. A guided outdoor sculpture tour is conducted the first Sunday of each month at 2PM, rain or shine. The tour lasts about 1.5 hours, and begins at the entrance of the Main Quad (where The Oval meets Serra Street). One of the most unique things in the USA is the New Guinea Sculpture Garden at Stanford. Made by New Guinean tribes people, it is a beautiful collection of wooden sculptures. (Next to Roble Dormitory, near the intersection of Lomita Drive and Santa Teresa Street)
Baylands Nature Preserve— The 1,940-acre Baylands Preserve brings you to the edge of San Francisco Bay and is a component of the critical wetlands needed to preserve wildlife and marine life in the San Francisco region; it is a great place to hike, bike, watch birds and enjoy an afternoon. The Lucy Evans Baylands Nature Interpretive Center has interesting educational programs for children and adults. Take Embarcadero Road east to the very end to get there.
Packard's Garage — 367 Addison Ave., Palo Alto. This restored garage is a museum, California Registered and National Historic Landmark -- the site where Hewlett-Packard was founded and the "Birthplace of Silicon Valley." You can only see this from the street.
Shockley's Laboratory — 391 San Antonio Road. The other birthplace of Silicon Valley. The first transistors were made here. It's now a Mexican grocery store. William Shockley was a brilliant researcher, but a lousy manager. His team (which included Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce (both co-founded Intel), Eugene Kleiner (founder of Kleiner-Perkins), Jean Hoerni (founder Union Carbide Electronics), Sheldon Roberts, and others) left to start Fairchild Semiconductors, which lead to Intel and many other companies. It was the silicon transistor that created Silicon Valley.
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, 2575 Sand Hill Rd, Menlo Park, 650 854 0683, www.slac.stanford.edu. Make time to go on a free public tour of one of the world's best-known experimental particle accelerators. Managed by Stanford University on behalf of the US Department of Energy, it attracts researchers from all over the world who like to smash tiny bits of matter together and then record the results.
Palo Alto Art Center, 1313 Newell Rd., Palo Alto, 650.329.2366, www.cityofpaloalto.org/artcenter. A nationally recognized visual arts center that offers a variety of exhibitions, classes, workshops and art education programs. Exhibitions include the best of contemporary fine art, craft, design and new art forms, with a particular emphasis on the art of the San Francisco Bay Area.
St. Thomas Aquinas Church, 751 Waverley St., Palo Alto. Fans of the classic cult film, Harold and Maude should head to St. Thomas Aquinas Church, the oldest church in Palo Alto (built in 1902). Intimate and beautiful, with ornate wood ceiling crossbeams and gorgeous stained-glass panels, the sanctuary is the perfect place to step out of the modern world and take a moment for peaceful solitude and reflection.
Do[edit][add listing]
Biking is a very popular Palo Alto activity. Road and off-road trails are plentiful.
Aerial tour if you are adventurous, you can see Palo alto from the air. There is a new modern power gilder at Palo Alto airport. You can see Stanford, get an idea of how long SLAC is, and be exposed to some of the most beautiful natural vistas.
Check out power glider tours at palo alto airport http://www.powerglidertours.com [13]
Walking trails abound in the hills to the west of Palo Alto. Check out the Arastradero Preserve [14] and the four-mile walking trail at the 150-foot diameter Stanford University Radio Telescope, which locals call "the Dish". The trailhead is at the intersection of Junipero Serra and Stanford Avenue. The public hiking trails are only accessible during daylight hours. Sorry, dogs are prohibited.
Check out a beautiful hike on skyline called Crazy Pete's hike.
Great view of Palo Alto city.
Maybe the best part of this hike is the history.
"Crazy" Pete was a miner who lived in Coal Creek preserve and built a road -- named Crazy Pete's road -- in the 1800s.
Most people don't know how Crazy Pete got his moniker.
The Stanford Theater [15]- An old theater showing classics from the 1930s through the 1950s (not open year round). Sometimes features an organist playing live before screenings.
Stanford University Free Lectures and Events, for info visit events.stanford.edu. Unless you are a student at Stanford, you won't get into classes for free at this acclaimed university, but there are some events and lectures open to the public each month. Parking can be hard to come by close to the venues of events, but the university runs a free shuttle bus, called the Marguerite, that picks up passengers at several locations including the Palo Alto California Avenue Caltrain station and deposits them within easy walking distance of most event sites. The online schedule of lectures and events is updated frequently and usually lists at least five to seven upcoming free happenings.
The Dish Walk, Stanford foothills, Junipero Serra Boulevard and Stanford Avenue. A great way to start the day, a 4 mile walk around Stanford's nature preserve that is complete with gorgeous views of the Bay and the city. Called the Dish Walk because of a radio telescope dish crowning the mountain, this network of paths and trails around the Stanford foothills west of Junipero Serra Blvd. offers numerous hillside trail runs and hikes.
Palo Alto Concours D'Elegance. A showcase of classic, pristine, often extremely valuable automobiles. This event is held every June at Stanford University. $25.  edit
Buy[edit][add listing]
Palo Alto's main shopping district is on University Avenue, between El Camino Real and Middlefield Road. It is a great long street of shopping, coffee spots, eateries and outdoor dining. Influenced by a college and upscale tech demographic, there is a variety of stores available from the local shop, to a unique designer store. A second, smaller shopping area is on California Avenue [16] between El Camino Real and Alma.
Stanford Shopping Center [17], Sand Hill Road and El Camino Real. A large upscale mall that features Neiman-Marcus, Nordstrom's, Bloomingdale, Macy's and one hundred and forty other stores.
Patrick James menswear, 855 El Camino Real, Ste 20, Town and Country Village, Palo Alto, 650-328-307. Offering traditional menswear, including cufflinks, suits, weekend wear, resort clothing, and custom-made shirts. Providing high quality suits and exceptional service.
Leaf & Petal, 439 California Ave, Palo Alto. Excellent womenswear boutique with great service and the best selection of contemporary apparel in town. They carry emerging designer brands and have a gorgeous selection of jewelry and handbags.
Lyons Limited Prints, 10 Town and Country Village, El Camino Real and Embarcadero, Palo Alto, 650-325-9010. Check out the impressive array of botanical and architectural prints, maps, and city views for sale. Any of the works sold here can be framed and shipped.
Cielo, 110 Stanford Shopping Ctr, Stanford Shopping Center, Palo Alto, 650-329-8833. High end designer labels can be found here, including Dries, Vanessa Bruno, Zucca, etc. While staff can be a little impersonal, concentrate on the beautiful fabrics and well cut clothing.
Eat[edit][add listing]
Buca di Beppo, 643 Emerson St, (650) 329-0665, [18]. Family style Italian cuisine, and they do mean family style - one entree will feed multiple people. They do accept reservations up to an hour before, so get there early.
Crowne Plaza Cabana, 4290 El Camino Real, (650) 857-0787, [19]. Features perhaps the most sumptuous brunch buffet that you may experience, on weekends only though.
Though a typical Sunday champagne brunch here is $30 (after tax and tip), the amount of food offered and the quality and freshness of food is impressive and well worth it.
Fuki Sushi [20]. Best Japanese food near Palo Alto, albeit expensive even by local standards.
Mango Cafe, 435 Hamilton Avenue, (650) 325-3229.
Caribbean restaurant with wonderful fruit juice drinks.
Order 'The Whole Island' if you're starving (jerked chicken wings, island rice, and chicken pelao).
Nola, 535 Ramona St, (650) 328-2722 [21] New Orleans themed restaurant with good food. Rowdy bar famous for its Hurricane cocktail.
PF Chang's, Stanford Shopping Center, (650) 330-1782, [22]. Offers California-style Asian cuisine in a bistro environment.
Pizza My Heart, 220 University Ave, (650) 327-9400, [23] By the slice or by the pie, this place serves up some pretty good pizza. Thin crust only.
Pluto's, 482 University Ave. (at Cowper), Ph: (650) 853-1556, Fax: (650) 327-9569, [24]. Some of the tastiest and healthiest sandwiches and salads to be found in the Bay Area. Anything with roasted turkey is particularly recommended.
Shokolaat 516 University Ave. Ph: (650) 289-0719, [25]. Wonderful modern bistro and chocolatier, serving lunch and dinner but also open in the morning for pastries and coffee. Some of the best food in town. Sit outside on a nice day on the expansive front patio.
Sprout, 168 University Ave. Ph: (650) 323-7688, [26] The best fresh salads in town, great home made soup including a killer butternut squash, delicious sandwiches and small bites. A great place to have lunch during a shopping or sightseeing trip downtown.
Straits Cafe, [27],
3295 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, (650) 494-7168. Lacking the hip ambiance of its San Jose counterpart, this chain restaurant offers safe, sanitized South East Asian cuisine. The samosas and roti prata are highly recommended and will start your meal off right.
Sundance Steakhouse, 1921 El Camino Real, Ph: (650) 321-6798. A very good steakhouse with superb prime rib and a great whiskey peppercorn sauce to go with it; pricey and worth it. The clam chowder is rich and delicious. The restaurant is quiet and provides excellent ambiance for a leisurely dinner.
Tamarine,
546 University Ave, Palo Alto, (650) 325-8500, [28]. With a cool but comfortable decor, Tamarine offers consistently well prepared Vietnamese cuisine. Pair your clay pot cod with a tasty cocktail from their extensive cocktail list, and combine it with exceptional service, and you have got the makings for a perfect night out.
Sushi House, 855 El Camino Real # 158, ☎ (650) 321-3453. Moderately priced Japanese Cuisine. A good alternative to Fuki Sushi.  edit
So Gong Dong Tofu House, 4127 El Camino Real, (650)424-8805. Gong Dong has a bright and cheery decor which complements the tasty and healthy cuisine. Dishes include tofu soup, beef dish, and short rib dish which are all rich tasting and delicious. Servers are standing by to explain the menu and the intricacies of the cuisine.
Taqueria El Grullense, 3636 El Camino Real, (650) 251-9317.
For the best Mexican food Palo Alto has to offer, visit the taqueria and be sure to give their salsa verde a try. Grullense has become famous for its "Super Burritos", which are tasty and very filling.
Zibibbo, 430 Kipling (between University and Lytton), (650) 328-6722, [29]. With a high price tag attached to the dishes, you would expect the quality of the good and service to match, but unfortunately, it does falter on occasion. With a huge layout, it's hard to convey ambiance and intimacy, although dishes such a roasted rabbit and wild mushroom pizza do exceed expectations.
Pizza Chicago, 4115 El Camino Real, ☎ (650) 424-9400. Su-Th: 11AM - 10PM F-Sa: 11AM - 11PM. Great deep dish pizza, although a tad more expensive than your average pie.  edit
Bistro Maxine, 548 Ramona St (Exit 101 onto University Ave go 2.2 miles turn left onto Ramona), ☎ 650 323 1815, [1]. Tues-Sa 8AM-10PM and Su 9AM-4PM closed Monday. Located in downtown Palo Alto, Bistro Maxine is the perfect location for French bistro feel and European atmosphere. Opened in June 2006, it is the only place to offer real authentic French crêpes. $8 - $15.  edit
La Bodeguita del Medio, 463 S. California Avenue, ☎ +1 650-326-7762, [2]. A great bar and restaurant featuring Cuban inspired cuisine. A friendly and welcoming neighborhood place with a walk-in humidor and smoking patio. There is also a great bar with over 50 sipping rums featuring Cuban inspired cuisine.  edit
Izzy's Brooklyn Bagels, 477 S California Ave., ☎ (650) 329-0700, [3]. M-Th 6AM-5PM, F 6AM-4PM, Sa-Su 7AM-3PM. Popular and rightly so.  edit
Drink[edit][add listing]
Antonio's Nut House, 321 S. California Avenue, (650) 321-2550. Popular destination for locals. Primarily a blue collar bar, but dot-com people come through every now and then for a round of pool. Free peanuts for patrons and you can even throw the shells onto the floor.
Empire Tap Room, 651 Emerson Street, (650) 321-3030. Bright, cheery bar considering the sometimes crusty clientele. Excellent wine list and delicious calamari.
The Old Pro, 541 Ramona St, (650) 326-1446, [30]. Loud, energetic sports bar in a high traffic part of downtown Palo Alto. A frequent for Stanford students to hang out at.
Bistro 412, 412 Emerson St., Palo Alto, 650.326.7183. Bistro 412 take care of their packed crowds beautifully with some nights devoted to DJ dancing, while others showcase live music and the heavy drinks are always flowing here. With a European vibe and a chic decor with an outdoor patio, it's a fun night out and recommended for smaller parties.
Gordon Biersch, 640 Emerson St., Palo Alto, 650.323.7723. Although their brick building looks like an unassuming basic beerhouse, they offer food that attempts to be a notch above. This local Palo Alto bar is a must do, especially with the beer being produced on-site. Or sample one of their classic, German inspired microbrews or seasonal specialty beers which, by the way, is an excellent way to spend an afternoon, or a very long evening.
This is the original brewery which spawned the nationwide Gordon Biersch chain.
Quattro Restaurant & Bar, 2050 University Avenue, ☎ 650-566-1200, [4]. Distinctive all-day restaurant, large outdoor terrace and bar. 1/2 price wine on Fridays.  edit

Stay safe[edit]
Palo Alto enjoys a very low crime rate, although visitors should take basic precautions against petty crime as with any tourist hotspot. Palo Alto's downtown is home to a small number of homeless people and beggars, but they are much less visible than their counterparts in Berkeley.
To the north of Palo Alto, the city of East Palo Alto and the unincorporated area of North Fair Oaks suffer from high crime rates and should be avoided or traversed quickly.
Be careful to check for ticks after hiking in fields in the Bay Area.
There is a high rate of Lyme disease transmission in the Bay Area.
If a bull's eye rash develops at the tick bite site, immediately seek medical assistance and treatment with antibiotics.
Contact[edit]
Downtown Palo Alto, along University Avenue, has free WiFi.
Apple Store, 451 University Avenue. All the computers are on wi-fi and free to use.
Palo Alto Cafe, 2675 Middlefield Road. Has a free wi-fi hotspot.
Palo Alto's Downtown Wi-Fi Internet Hotzone, [37]
Get out[edit]
Palo Alto is a good base of operations for visiting both the Silicon Valley and San Francisco, as it is halfway between that city and San Jose.
Trips to San Francisco on Caltrain leave frequently and stop just south of downtown.
The ride lasts about an hour, and Caltrain's rush-hour Baby Bullets travel the distance even faster. Check out Caltrain schedules [38], and make sure to buy a ticket before boarding.
To the west, the beautiful Coastal Range provides excellent biking, hiking, and other outdoor sports. Taking Page Mill Road due west will get you, eventually, to Highway 1 on the beautiful peninsula coast (although Highways 84 and 92 are preferable, especially the latter). And Santa Cruz is accessible from Highway 17, Skyline Boulevard (Highway 35 to Highway 9), or beautiful Highway 1.
If you're touring universities, the University of California, Berkeley is just across the bay. Take US-101 north through San Francisco and across the Bay Bridge to I-580 north, exiting University Avenue. Or by public transport, take the Stanford Marguerite shuttle to CalTrain and ride the Caltrain to Millbrae. At Millbrae, switch to BART and ride to Downtown Berkeley. (See 511.org [39] for more).

Palo Alto is a bustling suburb in Santa Clara County south of the city of San Francisco. It is adjacent to Stanford University and home to hundreds of Silicon Valley technology companies, ranging from VMware and Hewlett-Packard to tiny startups operating in garages.
Understand[edit]
Palo Alto means tall tree in Spanish, and in this case refers to an aging redwood tree at the north end of the city appropriately named "El Palo Alto". The 1061-year-old Coast Redwood, which stands 110 feet (34 m) high and has a base diameter of 90 inches (229 cm), marks a campsite for the Portola Expedition Party of 1769.

Get in[edit]
37°25′1″N 122°7′59″W
Map of Palo Alto
Accessible by train, bus or automobile from nearby San Francisco (about 25 miles/40 km) and San Jose (about 20 miles/32 km) airports. US 101 is the primary highway access, although I-280 also passes through the western edge of Palo Alto. Palo Alto Municipal Airport, which is a few miles from the center of the city, serves private aircraft.
By plane[edit]
The cheapest way to get to Palo Alto from the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) is to take SamTrans bus KX or 292 to Hillsdale Station and transfer to route ECR for $2.25 + $2.25 = $5.50. A potentially quicker alternative is to take BART from SFO to Millbrae, and then take Caltrain from Millbrae to Palo Alto, which will cost $4.40 + $5.75 = $10.15. This is far more of a hassle than it may seem, as BART only has direct service from SFO to Millbrae on late evenings and weekends; during weekdays, one must switch at San Bruno, taking two trains just to go one stop down the line, and on evenings and weekends, Caltrain runs only once per hour.
UberPOOL pricing is highly variable, but can drop as low as $13-15 if multiple riders are heading in your direction.
From the San Jose International Airport (SJC), you first take the free shuttle bus #10 to get to the Santa Clara Caltrain station. From there you either take Caltrain, for $5.75, or take VTA bus 522 or 22 to get to Palo Alto for $2.
Get around[edit]
By bus[edit]
Bus service runs through some major areas within the city. Routes are concentrated around El Camino Real and University Avenue. The Palo Alto Shuttle is free, and serves the otherwise unserved Embarcadero Road corridor, as well as the VA Hospital.
By bike[edit]
Bike lanes are nearly everywhere and make riding convenient and safe. One of the most prominent lanes runs down Bryant Street and takes you from South Palo Alto to the downtown district located in North Palo Alto.
By car[edit]
Palo Alto traffic is not usually very congested, and parking is plentiful everywhere except the downtown area. Municipal parking is free and fairly well dispersed, but usually limited to 2 hours during the business day.
By train[edit]
Palo Alto and California Avenue are stops along the Bay Area train route known as Caltrain. Both stations also have free shuttles (The Marguerite), which go to the Stanford University campus.
See[edit]
37.4575-122.10761 Baylands Nature Preserve. The 1,940-acre Baylands Preserve brings you to the edge of San Francisco Bay and is a component of the critical wetlands needed to preserve wildlife and marine life in the San Francisco region; it is a great place to hike, bike, watch birds and enjoy an afternoon. The Lucy Evans Baylands Nature Interpretive Center has interesting educational programs for children and adults. Take Embarcadero Road east to the very end to get there.
37.44303-122.154662 Packard's Garage, 367 Addison Ave. This restored garage is a museum, California Registered and National Historic Landmark -- the site where Hewlett-Packard was founded and the "Birthplace of Silicon Valley." You can only see this from the street.
37.44410-122.139223 Palo Alto Art Center, 1313 Newell Rd, ☎ +1-650-329-2366. A nationally recognized visual arts center that offers a variety of exhibitions, classes, workshops and art education programs. Exhibitions include the best of contemporary fine art, craft, design and new art forms, with a particular emphasis on the art of the San Francisco Bay Area.
37.44503-122.156684 St. Thomas Aquinas Church, 751 Waverley St. Fans of the classic cult film, Harold and Maude should head to St. Thomas Aquinas Church, the oldest church in Palo Alto (built in 1902). Intimate and beautiful, with ornate wood ceiling crossbeams and gorgeous stained-glass panels, the sanctuary is the perfect place to step out of the modern world and take a moment for peaceful solitude and reflection.
37.41145-122.106725 Shockley's Laboratory, 391 San Antonio Rd. The other birthplace of Silicon Valley. The first transistors were made here. It was most recently an international grocery store, but is now vacant. William Shockley was a brilliant researcher, but a lousy manager. His team - which included Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce (co-founders of Intel), Eugene Kleiner (founder of Kleiner-Perkins), Jean Hoerni (founder Union Carbide Electronics), Sheldon Roberts, and others - left to start Fairchild Semiconductors, which lead to Intel and many other companies. It was the silicon transistor that created Silicon Valley.
37.4275-122.16976 Stanford University (just outside Palo Alto). Offers cultural, athletic, natural and educational resources to Palo Alto visitors. For example, Outdoor Sculpture at Stanford University includes a very large collection of large scale works by Rodin in a garden immediately adjoining the Museum of Art, which is also home to a large collection of Rodin sculptures including one of his most famous works, Le Penseur (The Thinker). Look for Andy Goldsworthy's River of Stone a few steps from the museum's front entry. A guided outdoor sculpture tour is conducted the first Sunday of each month at 2PM, rain or shine. The tour lasts about 1.5 hours, and begins at the entrance of the Main Quad (where The Oval meets Serra Street). The New Guinea Sculpture Garden, created by New Guinean tribes people, is a beautiful collection of wooden sculptures (next to Roble Dormitory, near the intersection of Lomita Drive and Santa Teresa Street).
Do[edit]
37.3781-122.18311 Arastradero Preserve, 1530 Arastradero Rd. A 533 acre open space that contains hiking, biking and equestrian trails.
37.3329-122.20162 Coal Creek Open Space Preserve (Skyline Boulevard). This 508 acre preserve has limited parking and is home 5.4 miles of trails, including Crazy Pete's trail, a beautiful hike with a great view. Maybe the best part of this hike is the history. "Crazy" Pete was a miner who lived in Coal Creek preserve and built a road -- named Crazy Pete's road -- in the 1800s. Most people don't know how Crazy Pete got his moniker. Free.
37.44516-122.162603 The Stanford Theater, 221 University Ave. An old theater showing classics from the 1930s through the 1950s (not open year round). Sometimes features an organist playing live before screenings.
Stanford University Free Lectures and Events. Unless you are a student at Stanford, you won't get into classes for free at this acclaimed university, but there are some events and lectures open to the public each month. Parking can be hard to come by close to the venues of events, but the university runs a free shuttle bus, called the Marguerite, that picks up passengers at several locations including the Palo Alto California Avenue Caltrain station and deposits them within easy walking distance of most event sites. The online schedule of lectures and events is updated frequently and usually lists at least five to seven upcoming free happenings.
37.41021-122.161024 The Dish Walk (trailhead is at the intersection of Junipero Serra and Stanford Avenue). A great way to start the day, a 4 mile walk around Stanford's nature preserve that is complete with gorgeous views of the Bay and the city. Called the Dish Walk because of a 150-foot diameter radio telescope dish crowning the mountain, this network of paths and trails around the Stanford foothills west of Junipero Serra Blvd. offers numerous hillside trail runs and hikes. The public hiking trails are only accessible during daylight hours. Sorry, dogs are prohibited.
Buy[edit]
Palo Alto's main shopping district is on University Avenue, between El Camino Real and Middlefield Road. It is a great long street of shopping, coffee spots, eateries and outdoor dining. Influenced by a college and upscale tech demographic, there is a variety of stores available from the local shop, to a unique designer store. A second, smaller shopping area is on California Avenue between El Camino Real and Alma.
37.44288-122.171261 Stanford Shopping Center, 660 Stanford Shopping Center (Sand Hill Road and El Camino Real). A large upscale mall that features Neiman-Marcus, Nordstrom's, Bloomingdale, Macy's and one hundred and forty other stores.

37.44336-122.160992 Gordon Biersch, 640 Emerson St, ☎ +1 650 323-7723. Although their brick building looks like an unassuming basic beerhouse, they offer food that attempts to be a notch above.

»The Stanford Dish
Located on Reservoir Road in the Stanford foothills, the Stanford Dish is a landmark radio telescope with scenic paved trail loops.
Built in 1966 by the Stanford Research institute, the 150-foot diameter (46 meter) dish was funded by the United States Air Force in order to study the composition of the atmosphere.
Because of its unique construction with a separate receiver and transmitter, the dish became a powerful means of communicating with satellites and spacecraft.
The dish’s communication range is so strong that it was able to transmit signals to the NASA Voyager spacecrafts on the outer edge of the solar system.
The 3.5-mile trail around the dish is popular with runners and joggers.

»HP Garage
Today, Hewlett-Packard is a global technology leader that inspires entrepreneurs and innovators all over the world. It all started in 1939 when two Stanford University friends Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard started working in Dave’s parents’ garage. With very little resources, they began creating innovative products such as audio oscillators, which were used by many sound engineers. Encouraged by their early success, they formed the company, the first and original Silicon Valley startup.
The garage where it all started is now a symbol and inspiration to all similar dreamers, and the garage, now meticulously restored and renovated, is visited daily by large numbers of other entrepreneurs who hope that one day their little startup will become a global giant.
The garage is not open for visitors, but you can pass by and take photos of the place that proves dreams do become reality. The HP Garage is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

»Terun, Palo Alto, California
Italians are serious about their pizzas, even when they make them on the other side of the Atlantic. Terun pizzas are true southern Italian pizzas, and the restaurant has the pedigree and papers from Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana to prove it. Everything about Terun’s pizzas is authentic, from the meticulous preparation process to use of the freshest ingredients. For us, that means crisp, thin, fire baked pie with delectable toppings.
San Daniele is an excellent example: it is loaded with Prosciutto San Daniele, cremini mushrooms, arugula, mozzarella, shaved Parmesan and truffle oil. Terun has a few other authentic and rare Neapolitan dishes such as baked cauliflower au gratin in light parmigiano cream and bread crumbs. Their wine list is extensive and features some superb Italian wines. The restaurant is small, sleek, and modern, and its patio is lovely, bright, and spacious. Read more

»Things to Do in Palo Alto: Hanna House
Located on Porter Drive on the campus of Stanford University, the Hanna House was the first house that Frank Lloyd Wright designed and built in the San Francisco area.
The project began in 1937, and it was Wright’s first and best example of a non-rectangular hexagonal design.
Listed as a U.S. National Historic Landmark, the design of the house is based on the honeycomb of a bee with many six-sided figures, numerous tiled terraces, and built-in furniture.
The house is sometimes referred to as the Hanna-Honeycomb House, and it was built for Jean and Paul R. Hanna, both educators associated with Stanford University.

It takes about three hours to complete the loop. Canyon Trail goes along the spine of the Monte Bello Preserve and is very popular among bicyclists. Monte Bello is a great place to watch birds’ migration, take in the views, or just enjoy being outdoors.

»Mandarin Roots, Palo Alto, CA
Mandarin Roots is not your average Chinatown Hunan restaurant. In fact, while its roots are in China, its branches and leaves are all over the place: they have Latin quesadillas, Italian mozzarella, Vietnamese banh mi sliders, Mongolian BBQ, Laotian chili aioli, and other interesting additions. However, the roots do matter, and the Chinese aspects are fresh, delicious, and inventive. Try their wonderful Peking Duck Fried Rice with roasted duck, caramelized onions, spring onions, pickled onions, and fresh cucumbers. The restaurant is lovely and situated in a cozy, attractive garden setting with blooming bougainvilleas and cheerful Chinese lanterns. Their Happy Hour is very popular, in great part because of the Chinese tapas they serve with drinks. Read more

»Curry Up Now
If you are tired of chasing your favorite Indian food truck down the streets of Palo Alto, Curry Up Now now has a “brick and mortar” place on Hamilton where you can satisfy your craving for hot naan, butter-dripping samosas, or spicy and flavorful curries. The restaurant is a counter-serve cafeteria-style, unpretentious, and utilitarian and most people simply order to go. The menu is a Westernized version of Indian street dishes that retain all the authentic flavors with a simple change in form – naan now serves as a burrito wrapper or in lieu of chips for dipping, many dishes are available vegetarian and gluten free, and everything is fresh and bursting with delicious spicy juices. Don’t forget to get your mango lasi, an addictive Indian soda. Read more

»Rinconada Park, Palo Alto, California

Established in 1922, Rinconada Park is the second oldest park in the city after El Camino Park.
Originally called Waterworks because of its proximity to a reservoir and a well, Rinconada, which is Spanish for “corner,” is set in a landscape of redwood and live oak trees.

»Patxi's Pizza
Patxi’s Pizza makes going out for pizza a revolutionary dining experience. The restaurant is not your regular pizza joint; it is pleasant and spacious, with modern understated décor, and it is the perfect place to bring a family or a bunch of friends for a meal.
The place is packed most nights, perhaps because of their deep-dish pizza, or what is often called Chicago-style pizza. Just don’t tell the Italians. The menu has other things, even thin-crust pizza, but the star of this show is their signature deep-dish pizza. It has flaky, crisp crust full of butter and a whole-wheat version is available too. They make their own tomato sauce from scratch every day. The toppings are simple, and there are often only one or two, but you get tasty things like prosciutto, garlic, and fennel sausages or artichoke hearts. All ingredients are fresh and seasonal, and the pizzas are made fresh while you are waiting.

»Tamarine
Coming to Tamarine is a feast for all the senses. This modern Vietnamese restaurant is sophisticated and elegant with warm and subdued colors accented by the original paintings of contemporary Vietnamese artists. Vietnamese cuisine is a thousand-year old fusion of various Asian influences, and it is astoundingly flavorful and rich in unique ingredients. It is commonly eaten together with family and friends, so plan on sharing. To get the idea of the Vietnamese flavors, textures, and colors, try a few of the starters, which are a true revelation. Entrees are large enough to share, but choosing only one can be a challenge. Try the fried jumbo prawns in tart tamarind sauce served with rice noodles. Tamarine Jade Bar is a lovely spot for a late night snack or interesting cocktails.

Sundance is luxurious and opulent in every aspect, from their intimate leather booths and mahogany-paneled walls to the crisp white tablecloths and romantic flickering candles. It is an excellent choice for a celebration or to bring a date you want to impress. The menu focuses on succulent beefsteaks, slow-roasted prime rib, and high quality seafood, including New England scallops, Scottish salmon, Chilean bass, and Australian lobster. The cuisine is fairly traditional, but everything is made to perfection. The portions are generous, but make sure to try their starters, especially the filet mignon spring rolls. The Sundance wine list is fantastic and has more than 450 bottles.

Dinah Hotel’s Poolside Restaurant is bathed in light and very cheerful. The indoor space features beautiful original art and a lovely fireplace for those chilly nights. The outdoor tables, surrounded by lush blooming garden, overlook a sparkling blue pool. It is a lovely spot for a lunch, but equally enchanting at night with the lights reflected in the water. Their breakfasts are very popular with locals and so are the lunch specials, which always feature something new such as Mediterranean Salad with arugula, romaine, tomatoes, onions, olives, feta cheese, Mary’s Organic Chicken, and lemon vinaigrette. The menu is traditional fresh and healthy Californian cuisine with many comfort food favorites, meaning there is something for everyone, from fish and chips and macaroni and cheese to filet mignon.

»The Counter Palo Alto
A burger is a burger, right? Not according to The Counter. They shook things up and came up with a new way of looking at our favorite meat patty. First, you do not have to have it in a bun – eating it from a bowl is fine, particularly for those with gluten intolerance or for those who don’t eat a lot of bread. And why should a burger mean only beef? They have turkey, bison, chicken, fish, and several veggies patties. The toppings and sauces are also much more varied than the traditional mayo and ketchup. In fact, you can just make the burger yourself – choose the bread, choose the meat, the salad, the topping, and cheese, and if you want, you can even bring it all home raw and cook it yourself. One thing The Counter insists on: all meats are organic and hormone- and antibiotic-free. If you think their burgers are innovative, try their milk shakes. The Chocolate Cherry Pinot Noir Shake with pinot noir wine, chocolate syrup, and cherries is delicious – just make sure the kids don’t get hold of it.

Palo Alto enjoys a Mediterranean climate, with dry summers and wet winters. Check Palo Alto's 7 day forecast at NOAA
Palo Alto means tall tree in Spanish, and in this case refers to an aging redwood tree at the north end of the city.
The 1061-year-old Coast Redwood, which stands 110 feet (34 m) high and has a base diameter of 90 inches (229 cm), marks a campsite for the Portola Expedition Party of 1769.
Get in[edit]
Accessible by train, bus or automobile from nearby San Francisco (about 25 miles/40 km) and San Jose (about 20 miles/32 km) airports. US 101 is the primary highway access, although I-280 also passes through the western edge of Palo Alto. Palo Alto Municipal Airport, which is a few miles from the center of the city, serves private aircraft.
By air[edit]
The cheapest way to get to Palo Alto from the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) was to take SamTrans bus KX, but this line no longer travels to Palo Alto.
It appears a connection in Redwood City is required.
An alternative is to take BART from SFO to Millbrae (via San Bruno on weekdays), and then take Caltrain from Millbrae to Palo Alto, which will cost $9.50.
Or take the KX (or another bus) to a CalTrain station.
From the San Jose International Airport (SJC), you first take the free shuttle bus #10 to get to the Santa Clara Caltrain station. From there you either take Caltrain, for $4.50, or take VTA bus 522 or 22 to get to Palo Alto for $2.
Get around[edit]
By bus[edit]
Bus service runs through most of the major areas within the city. Routes are concentrated around El Camino Real and University Avenue.
The Palo Alto Shuttle is free, and serves the otherwise unserved Embarcadero Road corridor, as well as the VA Hospital.
By bike[edit]
Bike lanes are nearly everywhere and make riding convenient and safe. One of the most prominent lanes runs down Bryant Street and takes you from South Palo Alto to the downtown district located in North Palo Alto.
By car[edit]
Automobiles are definitely the most convenient way to get around, and parking is plentiful everywhere except the downtown area. Municipal parking is complimentary and fairly well dispersed, but usually limited to 2 hours during the business day.
By train[edit]
Palo Alto and California Avenue are stops along the Bay Area train route known as Caltrain [12]. Both stations also have free shuttles (The Marguerite), which go to the Stanford University campus.
See[edit][add listing]
Stanford University— Located just outside Palo Alto. Offers cultural, athletic, natural and educational resources to Palo Alto visitors. For example, Outdoor Sculpture at Stanford University includes a very large collection of large scale works by Rodin in a garden immediately adjoining the museum of art. Look for Andy Goldsworthy's River of Stone a few steps from the museum's front entry. A guided outdoor sculpture tour is conducted the first Sunday of each month at 2PM, rain or shine. The tour lasts about 1.5 hours, and begins at the entrance of the Main Quad (where The Oval meets Serra Street). One of the most unique things in the USA is the New Guinea Sculpture Garden at Stanford. Made by New Guinean tribes people, it is a beautiful collection of wooden sculptures. (Next to Roble Dormitory, near the intersection of Lomita Drive and Santa Teresa Street)
Baylands Nature Preserve— The 1,940-acre Baylands Preserve brings you to the edge of San Francisco Bay and is a component of the critical wetlands needed to preserve wildlife and marine life in the San Francisco region; it is a great place to hike, bike, watch birds and enjoy an afternoon. The Lucy Evans Baylands Nature Interpretive Center has interesting educational programs for children and adults. Take Embarcadero Road east to the very end to get there.
Packard's Garage — 367 Addison Ave., Palo Alto. This restored garage is a museum, California Registered and National Historic Landmark -- the site where Hewlett-Packard was founded and the "Birthplace of Silicon Valley." You can only see this from the street.
Shockley's Laboratory — 391 San Antonio Road. The other birthplace of Silicon Valley. The first transistors were made here. It's now a Mexican grocery store. William Shockley was a brilliant researcher, but a lousy manager. His team (which included Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce (both co-founded Intel), Eugene Kleiner (founder of Kleiner-Perkins), Jean Hoerni (founder Union Carbide Electronics), Sheldon Roberts, and others) left to start Fairchild Semiconductors, which lead to Intel and many other companies. It was the silicon transistor that created Silicon Valley.
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, 2575 Sand Hill Rd, Menlo Park, 650 854 0683, www.slac.stanford.edu. Make time to go on a free public tour of one of the world's best-known experimental particle accelerators. Managed by Stanford University on behalf of the US Department of Energy, it attracts researchers from all over the world who like to smash tiny bits of matter together and then record the results.
Palo Alto Art Center, 1313 Newell Rd., Palo Alto, 650.329.2366, www.cityofpaloalto.org/artcenter. A nationally recognized visual arts center that offers a variety of exhibitions, classes, workshops and art education programs. Exhibitions include the best of contemporary fine art, craft, design and new art forms, with a particular emphasis on the art of the San Francisco Bay Area.
St. Thomas Aquinas Church, 751 Waverley St., Palo Alto. Fans of the classic cult film, Harold and Maude should head to St. Thomas Aquinas Church, the oldest church in Palo Alto (built in 1902). Intimate and beautiful, with ornate wood ceiling crossbeams and gorgeous stained-glass panels, the sanctuary is the perfect place to step out of the modern world and take a moment for peaceful solitude and reflection.
Do[edit][add listing]
Biking is a very popular Palo Alto activity. Road and off-road trails are plentiful.
Aerial tour if you are adventurous, you can see Palo alto from the air. There is a new modern power gilder at Palo Alto airport. You can see Stanford, get an idea of how long SLAC is, and be exposed to some of the most beautiful natural vistas.
Check out power glider tours at palo alto airport http://www.powerglidertours.com [13]
Walking trails abound in the hills to the west of Palo Alto. Check out the Arastradero Preserve [14] and the four-mile walking trail at the 150-foot diameter Stanford University Radio Telescope, which locals call "the Dish". The trailhead is at the intersection of Junipero Serra and Stanford Avenue. The public hiking trails are only accessible during daylight hours. Sorry, dogs are prohibited.
Check out a beautiful hike on skyline called Crazy Pete's hike.
Great view of Palo Alto city.
Maybe the best part of this hike is the history.
"Crazy" Pete was a miner who lived in Coal Creek preserve and built a road -- named Crazy Pete's road -- in the 1800s.
Most people don't know how Crazy Pete got his moniker.
The Stanford Theater [15]- An old theater showing classics from the 1930s through the 1950s (not open year round). Sometimes features an organist playing live before screenings.
Stanford University Free Lectures and Events, for info visit events.stanford.edu. Unless you are a student at Stanford, you won't get into classes for free at this acclaimed university, but there are some events and lectures open to the public each month. Parking can be hard to come by close to the venues of events, but the university runs a free shuttle bus, called the Marguerite, that picks up passengers at several locations including the Palo Alto California Avenue Caltrain station and deposits them within easy walking distance of most event sites. The online schedule of lectures and events is updated frequently and usually lists at least five to seven upcoming free happenings.
The Dish Walk, Stanford foothills, Junipero Serra Boulevard and Stanford Avenue. A great way to start the day, a 4 mile walk around Stanford's nature preserve that is complete with gorgeous views of the Bay and the city. Called the Dish Walk because of a radio telescope dish crowning the mountain, this network of paths and trails around the Stanford foothills west of Junipero Serra Blvd. offers numerous hillside trail runs and hikes.
Palo Alto Concours D'Elegance. A showcase of classic, pristine, often extremely valuable automobiles. This event is held every June at Stanford University. $25.  edit

Buca di Beppo, 643 Emerson St, (650) 329-0665, [18]. Family style Italian cuisine, and they do mean family style - one entree will feed multiple people. They do accept reservations up to an hour before, so get there early.
Crowne Plaza Cabana, 4290 El Camino Real, (650) 857-0787, [19]. Features perhaps the most sumptuous brunch buffet that you may experience, on weekends only though.
Though a typical Sunday champagne brunch here is $30 (after tax and tip), the amount of food offered and the quality and freshness of food is impressive and well worth it.
Fuki Sushi [20]. Best Japanese food near Palo Alto, albeit expensive even by local standards.
Mango Cafe, 435 Hamilton Avenue, (650) 325-3229.
Caribbean restaurant with wonderful fruit juice drinks.
Order 'The Whole Island' if you're starving (jerked chicken wings, island rice, and chicken pelao).

Pluto's, 482 University Ave. (at Cowper), Ph: (650) 853-1556, Fax: (650) 327-9569, [24]. Some of the tastiest and healthiest sandwiches and salads to be found in the Bay Area. Anything with roasted turkey is particularly recommended.
Shokolaat 516 University Ave. Ph: (650) 289-0719, [25]. Wonderful modern bistro and chocolatier, serving lunch and dinner but also open in the morning for pastries and coffee. Some of the best food in town. Sit outside on a nice day on the expansive front patio.
Sprout, 168 University Ave. Ph: (650) 323-7688, [26] The best fresh salads in town, great home made soup including a killer butternut squash, delicious sandwiches and small bites. A great place to have lunch during a shopping or sightseeing trip downtown.
Straits Cafe, [27],
3295 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, (650) 494-7168. Lacking the hip ambiance of its San Jose counterpart, this chain restaurant offers safe, sanitized South East Asian cuisine. The samosas and roti prata are highly recommended and will start your meal off right.
Sundance Steakhouse, 1921 El Camino Real, Ph: (650) 321-6798. A very good steakhouse with superb prime rib and a great whiskey peppercorn sauce to go with it; pricey and worth it. The clam chowder is rich and delicious. The restaurant is quiet and provides excellent ambiance for a leisurely dinner.
Tamarine,
546 University Ave, Palo Alto, (650) 325-8500, [28]. With a cool but comfortable decor, Tamarine offers consistently well prepared Vietnamese cuisine.

Dishes include tofu soup, beef dish, and short rib dish which are all rich tasting and delicious. Servers are standing by to explain the menu and the intricacies of the cuisine.
Taqueria El Grullense, 3636 El Camino Real, (650) 251-9317.
For the best Mexican food Palo Alto has to offer, visit the taqueria and be sure to give their salsa verde a try. Grullense has become famous for its "Super Burritos", which are tasty and very filling.
Zibibbo, 430 Kipling (between University and Lytton), (650) 328-6722, [29]. With a high price tag attached to the dishes, you would expect the quality of the good and service to match, but unfortunately, it does falter on occasion. With a huge layout, it's hard to convey ambiance and intimacy, although dishes such a roasted rabbit and wild mushroom pizza do exceed expectations.
Pizza Chicago, 4115 El Camino Real, ☎ (650) 424-9400. Su-Th: 11AM - 10PM F-Sa: 11AM - 11PM. Great deep dish pizza, although a tad more expensive than your average pie.  edit

Antonio's Nut House, 321 S. California Avenue, (650) 321-2550. Popular destination for locals. Primarily a blue collar bar, but dot-com people come through every now and then for a round of pool. Free peanuts for patrons and you can even throw the shells onto the floor.
Empire Tap Room, 651 Emerson Street, (650) 321-3030. Bright, cheery bar considering the sometimes crusty clientele. Excellent wine list and delicious calamari.

Gordon Biersch, 640 Emerson St., Palo Alto, 650.323.7723. Although their brick building looks like an unassuming basic beerhouse, they offer food that attempts to be a notch above. This local Palo Alto bar is a must do, especially with the beer being produced on-site. Or sample one of their classic, German inspired microbrews or seasonal specialty beers which, by the way, is an excellent way to spend an afternoon, or a very long evening.
This is the original brewery which spawned the nationwide Gordon Biersch chain.

Stay safe[edit]
Palo Alto enjoys a very low crime rate, although visitors should take basic precautions against petty crime as with any tourist hotspot. Palo Alto's downtown is home to a small number of homeless people and beggars, but they are much less visible than their counterparts in Berkeley.
To the north of Palo Alto, the city of East Palo Alto and the unincorporated area of North Fair Oaks suffer from high crime rates and should be avoided or traversed quickly.
Be careful to check for ticks after hiking in fields in the Bay Area.
There is a high rate of Lyme disease transmission in the Bay Area.
If a bull's eye rash develops at the tick bite site, immediately seek medical assistance and treatment with antibiotics.
Contact[edit]
Downtown Palo Alto, along University Avenue, has free WiFi.
Apple Store, 451 University Avenue. All the computers are on wi-fi and free to use.
Palo Alto Cafe, 2675 Middlefield Road. Has a free wi-fi hotspot.
Palo Alto's Downtown Wi-Fi Internet Hotzone, [37]
Get out[edit]
Palo Alto is a good base of operations for visiting both the Silicon Valley and San Francisco, as it is halfway between that city and San Jose.
Trips to San Francisco on Caltrain leave frequently and stop just south of downtown.
The ride lasts about an hour, and Caltrain's rush-hour Baby Bullets travel the distance even faster. Check out Caltrain schedules [38], and make sure to buy a ticket before boarding.
To the west, the beautiful Coastal Range provides excellent biking, hiking, and other outdoor sports. Taking Page Mill Road due west will get you, eventually, to Highway 1 on the beautiful peninsula coast (although Highways 84 and 92 are preferable, especially the latter). And Santa Cruz is accessible from Highway 17, Skyline Boulevard (Highway 35 to Highway 9), or beautiful Highway 1.
If you're touring universities, the University of California, Berkeley is just across the bay. Take US-101 north through San Francisco and across the Bay Bridge to I-580 north, exiting University Avenue. Or by public transport, take the Stanford Marguerite shuttle to CalTrain and ride the Caltrain to Millbrae. At Millbrae, switch to BART and ride to Downtown Berkeley. (See 511.org [39] for more).
